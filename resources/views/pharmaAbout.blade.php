            <p class="blocktext">A year later the company started to expand internationally.
			Teva entered the European market when it acquired Dutch firm Orphahell,
			and in 1982, Teva’s manufacturing facility in Kfar Saba,
			Israel, received official FDA approval.
			In 1987 Teva secured its foothold in the US market through a joint venture with W.R. Grace,
			which in turn acquired Lemmon in Sellersville, Pennsylvania.</p>
            <p class="blocktext" class="text-black" >Teva's first major innovative medicine was developed for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, 
			and was launched in the US in 1996,
			and in Europe in 2001.
			During this period of significant growth,
			the company assumed leadership of the US generics sector and made major acquisitions in North America,
			Europe and other key markets.

            <p class="blocktext" class="text-black">Overall growth in the global pharma market is expected to be in the mid-single digits,
			which is promising. That growth is being accelerated by tailwinds such as an aging population with greater healthcare needs and the increasing adoption of Western lifestyles in emerging markets.
			Our R&D productivity efforts will continue to be driven by unmet medical needs in biopharma.

            <p class="blocktext" class="text-black" >Greater awareness of health and quality of life in society in general will increase demand for innovation as we move forward.</p>
